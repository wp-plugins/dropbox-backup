= Webpage Backup on Dropbox =

For security of your sites, webs hops or online portals is backup a must. With backup from www.webpage-backup.com you can secure backup and restore all your projects independent if it webpage or woocommerce shop as to make restoring from your backups. From security reasons it is impotent to schedule your backups, thereby your information or comments from your databases no go lost. Of course the more important for the security are (frequently) backups for woocommerce shops or multisite backups and there one click to restores from your backup drive. The woocommerce backups need more storage in cloud due to large files.
But in most cases it isn’t needed to make full backup. With help of our service webpage-backup.com you can select the folder or special databases that you must backup or to backup single webpage inside your hosting. But for our service it does not matter if the files are large or small, in case of the restoration it is the same. As well as for your local backup. Local backup are done on your hosting. If your hosting have enough space for backup it is ok, but it is not recommended. In most cases for storage your full backup on space of your hosting it is not enough space otherwise it is not safe enough, especially if something happen with your hosting or after some time you want to change your hosting provider. Additional if your make automate schedule backups or data base backups ever after some time the space on your backup drive will be full. For this reason the best is to use the Dropbox storage. Dropbox storage is scalable.  Of course the scheduler dropbox backup it is not a must. You can make it manually and for free, but it easy to forget and the danger to lose your backup data are big. You must not to upload your dropbox backup on your PC or desktop you can directly restoring your webpage from dropbox drive.  Independently of our service it is possible to downloading, uploading the data from the dropbox account. By dropbox backup with www.webpage-backup.com you can make exclusions of folders or by restoring import archives or whole bundle of archives. By dropbox backup or wep page cloning or migration of the sites it is important that all folders have permissions to write it is the same how permission to access the folder or to uploading it. For backup on dropbox it is does not matter if your site have ssl certificate or it is normal woocommerce shop without ssl certificate the same goes for migrating or for webpage clone. For our service www.webpage-backup.com it is important that our servise have permissions to the folders and to backup drive. 

= Special functions =

To the special functions of our webpage backup doesn’t belong the migration, scheduler backup, cron backup, wpmu backup, shop backup and encryption by cloning, if you make some clone of your website or multisite clone. It is all normal functions of our plugin or service at our webpage www.webpage-backup.com. The most of this tools are free of charge, especially if you do it manually. But inside our multisite tools are other addons and functions. Addons for your pages or multisite (WPMU) peges you can add inside of your service account if you want.  But for some of this function it is required to register on www.webpage-backup.com. For manage of multisites or just for one page menaging, for cron and scheduled dropbox backup as for full restoration of you WooCommerce shop, webpage or multisite as well as for migration - to register it is must. It is not possible to do full restoration of webpage from dropbox backup without the WordPress site self. 

= Easy backup =

By draw up of our dropbox backup tools we try to do the backup or restoring ever for not experts and multisites owners, but with the same tools how for experts. For experts we have Buckup explorer where the expert can select or to do exclusion of files and webpages. As the register user you can use multiple dropbox account or create other multisite buckup drive clouds, how FTP or you can do the local backup on the site of your host. All automatically functions are inside of our service. To automatically tools belong: cron and scheduler, migrator and remote. Scheduled jobs for dropbox you can set in our calendar, it gives overview. 

= Cloning, duplicate or migrate of websites =

Cloning, duplicate or migrate in principal all the function a same. It gives you the possibility quickly to create site clone with as “templates” for multiple site.  This clone tool is very useful, if you have more than one webpage or, if you want to clone or duplicate your web page. With full backup of your old site or WooCommerce shop you can clone or duplicate, and create new clone of webshop or webpage with one click. All multisite backups functions are available from one dashboard of cloning tool, how multisite backup, as well as WPMU backup in the same cloud or in several cloud storages of hosting provider or just server. From same dashboard available clone restorations functions separate or in bundle, depend of your multisite backup settings. If your do so much settings you can remove not needed settings or clone of backup. The settings must be removed separately ever for multisite or clone. The backup dropbox storages must be removed separately too. Although it seems complicated to do automatic backup. With our backup plugin for backup, clone or migrate - you can make it without expert knowledge. Clone add-ons allow your easy backup or migrate your website or WPMU (multisite). "Dropbox backup" is just ultimate tool for WordPress that can worst your productivity by cloning of web pages, allowing you to do efficiently manage of cloned pages due clone or multisite installations.

= Easy data restoring =

For restoring your webpage (or multisite webpage) selected files from the dashboard and then select files to restore. In backup list you see the type, date and size. From the list you can remove and select appropriate restoring file. In settings your can add or remove the cloud storage.  In case of cloning you must restore your old webpage backup on other webpage. Cloning is the same how resorting but in more steps. The same bee meant for migrating of multisite and shops and there restore. With our file explorer you can match every file separately for restoration. In case of restoration only this files will be restore. You can restore one file than the next, but it easy to make restoring in bundle or directly to recover whole full backup. The restoration time depend from your hosting and upload rate as well as restoration depend from the file size witch must be restore. Scheduled restoring and recovering isn’t possible, unless somebody have special inquiry on our service to do scheduled recovering. The recover from the Dropbox cloud storage take time, depend from the web site size and right permissions of the folders of your hosting provider. 

= What to do if recovering failed? =

First of all check the data spelling. It is most common mistake. Other common mistakes by recovering are: 
* to recover from wrong cloud storage
* if done alone database back up – not full and you can’t see the recover sites 
* by recovering process there was internet interruption 
* In your database are file exclusions
* your database back up was not consistent
* file archive of back up with a broken checksum 
* back up or restore from damaged cloud storage
* misspelled back up due user failed restore

Large file and big size databases need more time to recover. It can take from 30 min until two hours or more, depend from the size of your back up database, but for our recovery service it doesn’t matter for uploading of large files or small files. The difference between recover the large files and small is the time. After check all this figures please write a letter on our support team http://www.webpage-backup.com and we will try to answer as soon as possible and to give you’re the best solution how easy to recover your site.
