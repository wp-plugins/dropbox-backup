Webpage Backup on Dropbox

For security of your sites, webs hops or online portals is backup a must. With backup from www.webpage-backup.com you can secure backup and restore all your projects independent if it webpage or woocommerce shop as to make restoring from your backups. From security reasons it is impotent to schedule your backups, thereby your information or comments from your databases no go lost. Of course the more important for the security are (frequently) backups for woocommerce shops or multisite backups and there one click to restores from your backup drive. The woocommerce backups need more storage in cloud due to large files.
But in most cases it isn’t needed to make full backup. With help of our service webpage-backup.com you can select the folder or special databases that you must backup or to backup single webpage inside your hosting. But for our service it does not matter if the files are large or small, in case of the restoration it is the same. As well as for your local backup. Local backup are done on your hosting. If your hosting have enough space for backup it is ok, but it is not recommended. In most cases for storage your full backup on space of your hosting it is not enough space otherwise it is not safe enough, especially if something happen with your hosting or after some time you want to change your hosting provider. Additional if your make automate schedule backups or data base backups ever after some time the space on your backup drive will be full. For this reason the best is to use the Dropbox storage. Dropbox storage is scalable.  Of course the scheduler dropbox backup it is not a must. You can make it manually and for free, but it easy to forget and the danger to lose your backup data are big. You must not to upload your dropbox backup on your PC or desktop you can directly restoring your webpage from dropbox drive.

By dropbox backup or wep page cloning or migration of the sites it is important that all folders have permissions to write it is the same how permission to access the folder or to uploading it. For backup on dropbox it is does not matter if your site have ssl certificate or it is normal woocommerce shop without ssl certificate the same goes for migrating or for webpage clone. For our service www.webpage-backup.com it is important that our servise have permissions to the folders and to backup drive. 

*Special functions

To the special functions of our webpage backup doesn’t belong the migration, scheduler backup, cron backup, wpmu backup, shop backup or encryption. It is all normal functions of our service. The most of this tools are free of charge, especially if you do it manually.  But inside our tools are other addons and functions. This addons you can add inside our service if you want.

This toll is very useful if you have more than one webpage. With your full backup of your old site or woocommerce shop you can clon/duplicate and create new shop or webpage with one click. All multisite backups functions are available from one dashboard, how multisite backup as well as wpmu backup in the same cloud or in several cloud storages. From same dashboard available restorations functions separate or in bundle, depend of your multisite backup settings. If your do so much settings you can remove not needed settings or backup.
